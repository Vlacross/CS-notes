constant time 0(1)

        -No matter the size of the input, the algorithm will take the sma eamount of time to complete



Logarithmic Time 0(Log(n))


        -takes longer with a larger input, though runTime increases slowly 

Linear Time 0(n)

        -Directly affected by size of input (size of 4 would take twice as long to process as 2)


Polynomial 0(n^k)

        -where input size n is raised to the power of input k
        -Such as nested for Loops


Exponential time 0(2^n)

        -increases rapidly based on input size
